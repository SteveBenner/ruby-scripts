### Homebrew
Fixes for Homebrew issues

**1. osxfuse** Some software, such as Bitcasa and TrueCrypt, install libs that don't brew nicely with others

### Util
Some miscellaneous scripts I wrote to make my life easier, or just for fun/experimentation.

- `diff-wrapper` executes a script to launch diff tool (RubyMine in this case) used with `git difftool`
- `sass-convert-dir` I wrote this before I knew about `sass-convert -R`, haha
- `shortcuttr` A neat script for creating executable bash scripts that act as bash command shortcuts
