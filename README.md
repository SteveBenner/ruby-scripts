## System
Scripts used for system-based tasks, configuration, and shortcuts, often as an alternative to Bash.

- `diff-wrapper` executes a script to launch diff tool (RubyMine in this case) used with `git difftool`

### Gists
Some tiny scripts I came up with. Most exists as gists on my GitHub account.
