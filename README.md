# Ruby Scripts
These are Ruby scripts I've either authored or modified.

Note: Scripts are designed and tested for use in **OS X 10.9 Mavericks** using my unique environment and tools; their functionality is not guaranteed in other systems.

### Util
Some miscellaneous scripts I wrote to make my life easier, or just for fun/experimentation.

- `diff-wrapper` executes a script to launch diff tool (RubyMine in this case) used with `git difftool`
- `sass-convert-dir` I wrote this before I knew about `sass-convert -R`, haha
- `shortcuttr` A neat script for creating executable bash scripts that act as bash command shortcuts

### Fun
- `lolping` Helps me from being farked up in solo Q by testing latency of their servers
